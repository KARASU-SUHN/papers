2. Possible Causes of Negative R² with Reasonable RMSE
2.1. Constant or Near-Constant Predictions
If EfficientNet_b0 is producing predictions that are close to the mean of the target values (i.e., not capturing the variance), the RMSE might be low because the predictions are reasonably close to the actual values. However, R² could be negative because the model isn’t explaining any variance—it’s essentially producing a "flat line" that doesn’t account for the structure of the data.

Impact: R² will be negative if the model predictions are close to the mean, even if RMSE is low. This can happen if the model is "playing it safe" by outputting values near the average.

2.2. Scale of the Target Variable
If the target variable has low variance or if it is scaled in a way that makes it hard for the model to capture the actual variance, you might see reasonable RMSE but a negative R². This happens because R² is sensitive to the ratio of explained variance to total variance, and if the total variance is low, the model’s explained variance might seem insufficient.

Impact: The target's variance is too low for R² to give a positive score, but RMSE remains reasonable because the errors are small relative to the target scale.
