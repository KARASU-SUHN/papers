The data format used in AlphaFold, as discussed in the paper "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold," includes several key types of inputs that are structured to predict protein folding:

1. **Amino Acid Sequences**: The primary input is the one-dimensional amino acid sequence of the protein. AlphaFold utilizes this sequence as the foundational data for folding predictions.

2. **Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)**: AlphaFold leverages large-scale sequence alignments. These MSAs are generated by comparing the target protein sequence with homologous sequences in large databases, allowing AlphaFold to understand evolutionary relationships.

3. **Templates**: Structural templates are used, which are obtained from protein databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB). These templates provide additional structural information based on proteins with known structures similar to the target sequence.

4. **Pairwise Features**: AlphaFold encodes pairwise relationships between residues (amino acids), which include geometric and spatial constraints. These pairwise features are essential for predicting how different parts of the protein interact.

The data is typically formatted in matrices that encode both sequence and spatial features, enabling the deep learning model to interpret and predict the final 3D protein structure. The architecture combines convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms to process these inputs efficiently.

In AlphaFold, each data type (sequence, MSAs, templates, and pairwise features) is represented and stored in structured formats that the model processes as input. Here is a breakdown of how each is handled:

### 1. **Amino Acid Sequences**
   - **Representation**: The amino acid sequence is represented as a one-dimensional array, where each position in the array corresponds to a specific residue (amino acid). Amino acids are typically encoded using integers or one-hot encodings to map the 20 standard amino acids into numerical form.
   - **Storage**: These sequences are stored as arrays, often in formats like `.fasta` files, which are simple text files where each sequence has a header line starting with `>`, followed by the sequence of amino acids in single-letter codes.

### 2. **Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)**
   - **Representation**: MSAs are two-dimensional arrays, where the rows represent aligned sequences from homologous proteins, and the columns correspond to positions in the target protein sequence. Gaps in the alignment are represented by special symbols (e.g., `-`).
   - **Storage**: MSAs are often stored in formats such as `.a3m` or `.sto`, where each sequence is aligned to the target sequence. The storage format is optimized for compactness while retaining gaps and alignments between homologous sequences.
   - **AlphaFold Specifics**: AlphaFold internally processes MSAs as features that encode the evolutionary information derived from these alignments, such as conservation patterns across species.

### 3. **Templates (from PDB)**
   - **Representation**: Templates are represented as 3D structures of proteins, typically stored in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) format. These structures provide atomic coordinates (x, y, z) for each atom in the protein and additional information like residue types and bonds.
   - **Storage**: Templates are stored in `.pdb` files or similar structural formats. Each file consists of lines starting with atom records, followed by the atomic coordinates and other metadata. AlphaFold extracts features like backbone torsion angles, residue identity, and pairwise distances from these templates.
   
### 4. **Pairwise Features (Residue-Residue Interactions)**
   - **Representation**: Pairwise features are stored as 2D matrices, where both dimensions correspond to positions in the amino acid sequence. Each element of the matrix encodes some pairwise property between two residues, such as evolutionary co-variation, spatial distance constraints, or contact probabilities.
   - **Storage**: These matrices are generated during the pre-processing stage and stored in memory while training or making predictions. They are often processed in formats like `.npz` or `.h5` (HDF5) for efficient storage and retrieval, especially for large datasets.

### 5. **Distograms and 3D Distance Predictions**
   - **Representation**: AlphaFold predicts a distribution of distances between pairs of residues, known as a "distogram." This is represented as a 2D grid, where each grid point represents a pair of residues, and the values are a probability distribution over possible distances.
   - **Storage**: These distograms are often stored in intermediate formats during training but can be represented and visualized using formats like `.npz` or as 2D arrays.

### Input Feature Representation in the Model
In summary, AlphaFold processes these various inputs into tensors (multidimensional arrays) that feed into the neural network. Common file formats used to store these inputs include:
- **.fasta** for amino acid sequences
- **.a3m**, **.sto** for multiple sequence alignments
- **.pdb** or **.mmCIF** for structural templates
- **.npz** or **.h5** for numerical data (e.g., distograms or pairwise matrices)


AlphaFold3, which incorporates diffusion models for protein structure prediction, marks a significant evolution from the earlier versions of AlphaFold. While AlphaFold2 uses a deep learning architecture based on attention mechanisms and relies heavily on MSAs and templates, AlphaFold3 integrates diffusion models, which are often used for generating structures by iteratively refining noisy data.

In the context of AlphaFold3, here’s how the inputs are likely structured:

### Inputs for AlphaFold3 (with Diffusion Models)

1. **Initial Noisy Protein Structure (or Coordinate Noise)**
   - **Representation**: In diffusion models, the initial input is often a noisy or incomplete version of the target structure. For AlphaFold3, this could be a partially unfolded or randomized set of atomic coordinates (3D positions of atoms in the protein).
   - **Storage**: This noisy structure is likely stored in a 3D coordinate format similar to the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or as a tensor of shape `[N, 3]`, where `N` represents the number of atoms, and the `3` corresponds to the x, y, z coordinates.

2. **Amino Acid Sequences**
   - **Representation**: Like in AlphaFold2, the amino acid sequence is represented as a one-dimensional array where each position corresponds to a specific residue.
   - **Storage**: The sequence is typically stored in `.fasta` or a similar text-based format and encoded into numeric form for model processing.

3. **Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)**
   - **Representation**: MSAs are still used as important inputs, providing evolutionary information and sequence homology. They remain as two-dimensional arrays representing the alignment of homologous sequences.
   - **Storage**: MSAs are stored in formats such as `.a3m` or `.sto` files, which encode aligned sequences with gaps.

4. **Structural Templates (Optional)**
   - **Representation**: Like in previous AlphaFold versions, structural templates can serve as initial guides to the model. These are structures from homologous proteins that are similar to the target sequence.
   - **Storage**: Templates are stored in `.pdb` or `.mmCIF` format, where each atom’s coordinates are represented in 3D space.

5. **Pairwise Residue Features**
   - **Representation**: The model processes pairwise features that encode the relationships between pairs of residues (e.g., distance constraints, co-variation).
   - **Storage**: These features are stored as 2D matrices where both dimensions correspond to the amino acid positions, similar to AlphaFold2.

6. **Diffusion Steps (Noising and Denoising States)**
   - **Representation**: The diffusion model works by progressively noising and denoising the protein structure. Each iteration refines the structure from a noisy representation toward a more accurate configuration. The noise level or "diffusion steps" could be represented as a sequence of structures, each with increasing noise or refinement.
   - **Storage**: These noisy structures and their corresponding noise levels are stored as tensors or coordinate arrays for each step of the diffusion process. Formats like `.npz` or `.h5` are suitable for efficiently storing large datasets of such structures.

### Summary of Inputs:
- **Amino Acid Sequences**: 1D array representing the sequence of residues.
- **MSAs**: 2D array storing homologous sequences.
- **Noisy 3D Structures**: The core input for the diffusion process, starting from an initial noisy structure that is refined.
- **Pairwise Features**: Matrices capturing residue interactions or constraints.
- **Templates (optional)**: Structures from homologous proteins, used to guide the prediction.

By leveraging diffusion models, AlphaFold3 likely focuses on improving the refinement process of protein structures from noisy or partially known states, generating highly accurate 3D structures through iterative updates. These inputs are transformed into tensors that the model processes to predict the final protein fold.

In AlphaFold3, the data format has evolved from previous versions to better integrate with its diffusion-based architecture, which models atomic coordinates directly. Here are the key types of data inputs used:

1. **Amino Acid Sequences**: The primary input remains the amino acid sequence of the protein, typically stored as a 1D array. This sequence is processed by the model to predict protein structures.

2. **Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs)**: MSAs are still a crucial input for AlphaFold3, providing evolutionary data on homologous sequences. These alignments are stored as 2D arrays, with formats like `.a3m` or `.sto` being common for efficient alignment storage.

3. **Noisy 3D Structures (Diffusion Model Input)**: In AlphaFold3’s diffusion-based model, an initial noisy or partially randomized 3D structure of the protein is provided. This noisy structure undergoes iterative refinement throughout the prediction process. These are represented as 3D coordinates, stored in formats like `.pdb` or `.cif`, which detail the positions of atoms.

4. **Pairwise Residue Features**: Similar to AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3 encodes pairwise relationships between amino acids, such as distance constraints or contact probabilities, using 2D matrices.

5. **Templates (Optional)**: Structural templates, when available, provide additional structural context and are stored in formats like `.pdb` or `.mmCIF`.

AlphaFold3 also incorporates features for predicting complex biomolecular interactions, including interactions between proteins and nucleic acids or small molecules, expanding the scope of its predictions beyond individual proteins【17†source】【18†source】.
